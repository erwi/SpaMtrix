Reading and writing of matrix market formatted files.

Creation of drift-diffusion test matrices.

Move BiCGStab and MinRes functions to IterativeSolvers class.

Python bindings.

Eigenavalue solvers.

Make spamtrix_blas into a class for easier friend access to IRCMatrix privates ??

Vectorise spamtrix_blas and iterative solvers.

Make use of incomplete cholesky decomposition faster. This probably involves storing both upper and lower diagonals of it. 

Sparse matrix row/column reoredering.

Cuthill-McKee and other bandwidth reduction algorithms.

Improve LU decomposition. Maybe start with LUD? Then pivoting.

Modified incomplete LU demcomposition (MILU)
